# ECP

This repository hosts the implementation of the Effective Critical Plane (ECP) method, a new approach for assessing fatigue strength in structural components under complex loading. By averaging the stress-strain field over a small material-dependent volume, the ECP method enhances traditional Critical Plane analysis, offering improved accuracy in predicting fatigue life, especially in areas with stress concentrations like notches and welds. The repository includes the source code, validation data, and example cases for researchers and engineers in fatigue analysis.

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:
